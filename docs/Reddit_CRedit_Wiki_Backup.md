### Disputing/Validation Are Your Tools

As much as credit card companies, loan companies, banks or debt collectors can tarnish your credit and financial freedom with a single keystroke, the USA has laws for the consumer - YOU! As much as a car repo company wants to list a $8000 debt on your report it is *your legal right* to challenge the validity of that debt and the bureaus themselves. They are **required** to keep records that allow them to list that negative information on your report. If they are not keeping the appropriate and legal paperwork, they are **not** allowed to list that account on your reports.

## Credit Repair, Maintenance, Improvement and Health

The following articles are guides and informational sources intended to improve your credit situation.

### Frequently Asked Credit Questions

**What is credit, and why do I care?**

Credit - in short - is a number score based on your risk to lenders. A higher score will give you better terms and interest rates on loans. A poor score will give you worse terms and interest rates, assuming you are approved for a credit line at all. For most day-to-day transactions, your credit score is not terribly important, but your score is critical when opening new lines of credit, say for a house or a car, or even just for a credit card.

**When I try to access my credit reports, I am being asked questions about accounts I have no knowledge of. Why?**

Credit Bureaus need to protect themselves and keep their information very secure. To be able to access your credit reports and sign up for services like CreditKarma they require you to 'confirm your identity' by answering security questions. The questions that ask you will be about phone numbers, addresses, names, employment, loans/mortgages and various other information they have on. Not only that, they slip in questions where the answer tends to be "None of the above". If the person requesting their credit report is really them, they will know they didn't open a mortgage in 2003 - a time when you may have still been in high school. But a hacker with your information *may not* know that, and try to guess. For extremely thin (empty, bare, new, etc) credit reports, your security questions may be 100% made up. They may have no information on you to even ask you relevant security questions. In those situations, answering "None of the above" would be the correct action to take.

**Why is my credit score different on Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian?**

For the most part, most major credit cards, loans, and department store cards report to the big 3 credit bureaus. Not all accounts do though, especially considering department store cards. Additionally, authorized user cards may not match to each bureau which depends on accurate personal information and may only match to 1 out of 3. Collections companies with not enough resources or authorization to report to all three may only report to one or two, and not all three. Your credit score is factored by using the information on your report at that bureau. As you can see, your reports may not all match because of different information (even slightly different information) and with it your score may be different depending on the bureau.

### Credit Repair Companies

In general, r/credit does not recommend using a credit repair company. Credit repair companies can't do anything you can't do yourself for free. Many use illegal tactics (disputing accurate information) that can backfire.

# Wiki: How Is Your Credit Score Calculated?

This is a simple and complex question all at the same time. The bottom line is, your credit score is a mathematical algorithm that calculates your risk to creditors based off your past credit history. But, before we can get into how it's calculated, we need to establish what we mean by "credit score".

## What is a credit score?

There are many different models that can be categorized as 'credit scores', depending on what the creditors needs are (Experian's Plus score for educational use only, for example) and what country you live in. While the information in this subreddit can most likely be applied to any scoring model in any country, the primary focus will be on the U.S. and the FICO system.

FICO was introduced in 1989 by Fair, Isaac, and Company, and has since become the go-to score for the vast majority of lenders to understand an individual's credit worthiness. There are several variants of the FICO score: classic, bankcard, personal finance, mortgage, installment loan, auto, and NextGen score, and there are three active 'generations' of these scores (1998, 2004, and 2008). Not all of these (or even most of these) are accessible by you, the consumer.

> **Fun fact:** between the three Credit Bureaus, three different 'generations', and 7 different score types - you have a total of 49 different scores. Note that not all Credit Bureaus use all possible combinations.

The classic FICO score is by far the most prominent, and for most people will be fairly representative of all their various scores. The classic has a range of 300 (horrible) to 850 (perfect). The median, or average, score is somewhere around 700, depending on where you live in the U.S. Most individual's score is between 600 - 750. To generalize a bit, credit scores are broken down into ranges as follows:

| Score | Range |
|-------|-------|
| below 630 | Bad |
| 630 - 689 | Fair |
| 690 - 719 | Good |
| 720 - 850 | Excellent |

It's worth mentioning that if you have a score over 760, you effectively have a score as high as you will ever need it. Having a score over 760 is certainly nice, but you are unlikely to see significant additional benefits from a score of 825 vs 760, for example. This is not to suggest that you shouldn't try to keep your score as high as possible, though, because you never know when you might fall on hard times and your credit may take a hit. If catastrophe strikes and you fall behind on your bills, let's say you lose 100 points: 825 minus 100 is 725, which still falls into the 'excellent' credit category, while dropping from 760 to 660 goes from excellent to middle-of-the-road fair score.

## How is the FICO Classic score calculated?

We have established that the FICO Classic is the most common score used, and therefore the one that we will focus on primarily.

As stated earlier, your score is a mathematical formula that calculates your risk to lenders. The exact formula is proprietary (i.e. secret), so no one *really* knows exactly how your score will be affected by your actions, but we do know quite a bit about how the score works. The score is based primarily off your credit history, which in a very broad view, comes down to how much debt you have and if you pay it off on time. A bit more specific, your score is calculated in the following categories:

| Category | % | Notes |
|----------|---|-------|
| Payment History | 35% | This category includes if you pay your bills on time, if you've had any debt go to collections and bankruptcies, along with other information regarding your past performance in paying your debts. Negative information (e.g. missed payments) will stay on your file for 7 years. Bankruptcies will stay on your file for 10 years. |
| Debt Burden | 30% | This category includes information on the total amount owed for all debts, the amount owed for different *types* of debts, how many accounts are carrying a balance, how much is left on a loan compared to the original amounts, and - probably the most well known - your revolving credit utilization ratio. |
| Time in File | 15% | This category is pretty straight forward. It's a combination of your oldest account and the average age of all accounts. |
| Credit Mix | 10% | This category includes what *types* of debt you have: Mortgage, car loan, credit cards, pay-day loans, etc. Certain types of debt are considered 'healthier' than others. Mortgages are considered healthy debt because people who own homes are *generally* more responsible with their money. Lenders want to see a healthy mix of the various types because it gives them an idea of how you handle various types of debt. |
| Inquiries | 10% | There are two types of inquiries: Soft and Hard. Generally speaking, if you request a new line of credit, that inquiry will be a 'hard' inquiry. All other inquiries (to check your credit score, for example) will generally be soft inquiries. Only hard inquiries affect your score, soft inquiries are for your information only, to see who has been looking at your score. Hard pulls stay on your file for 2 years. |

## What is not part of the FICO scoring system?

Your score does not include anything other than what is included in the categories above. Your score is not affected by your race, sex, religion, marital status, age, salary, income, employer, employment history, where you live, the interest rates of any of your debt, rental agreements, child support, or any other information that is deemed ineffective at predicting your ability to repay a debt.

## How long does it take to see changes to your score?

It depends on what changes you are making, but generally you can see changes pretty quickly - sometimes in as little as a week. How much of a change is another question completely. This can vary greatly depending on what you are doing. Say you request a new credit line and the lender does a hard inquiry. You may see this on your report in just a few days and notice a 3 - 5 point drop in your score. However, once the new line of credit is added to your file, your score could go up, down or not change at all, depending on a myriad of possible situations.

If you make changes that you believe should affect your score and you do not see them listed in your file within 2 months of when you initiated the change, you should most likely start asking questions. There is no good answer here other than call your lender and see who they are reporting the debt to and when they reported it.

# Wiki: Why Submit Disputes in Writing vs Online/Phone

There are some definite advantages towards submitting your disputes in writing versus doing it online or by phone.

## Build your paper trail

The number one thing you should do when repairing your credit is build up your paper trail - and you should be doing this as much as possible. By doing your dispute in writing via mail, you are able to prove that you made a contact to the credit bureaus. Not only that, you can enforce them to abide by the law and conduct your investigation within 30 days of your receipt (certified mail). Credit bureaus must follow the law, and as such *must* complete your investigation by 30 days.

## Send in additional documentation

Sending in your dispute by mail gives you the ability to send as much supporting documentation to support your dispute as possible. Instead of clicking the "Not Mine" or "No Knowledge of Account" button online, you can actually send the research and due diligence you performed while researching that account. Do you have an auto repo and are in collections? If you have it in writing that the debt collector does not have the required information to list that account (original account information, original auto loan docs, etc) then send it right along.

It should be noted, on some bureaus you *may* send in additional documentation. I do not believe at this time all 3 support that, and you have to work within their system and its' limitations.

## Explain your situation

Again, instead of being extremely limited by the online system, you are able to fully articulate why you believe the dispute is valid and the information should be corrected or deleted. Did a credit card company agree to remove the '90 day late' that you had 4 years ago, but it hasn't been updated on all 3 bureaus? Explain the situation, and send that doc along with it!

## What benefits me from disputing via online or by phone?

The one benefit from disputing via online or by phone is speed. Your dispute is entered into their system instantly, and as such will begin to process. The turn around time will be vastly improved, while sacrificing the paper trail, additional documentation, and clarity in the situation.

# Wiki: Guide To Performing A Pay For Deletion

## What is pay for deletion?

Pay for deletion (PFD) is one of the many tools you have in your toolbox that can completely erase collection accounts on your credit reports. The premise is simple, you offer to pay a certain amount owed to a collections company, and in exchange the collections company deletes the account from your credit reports. It is a win/win for the collections company as they pay literally pennies on the dollar to purchase that account, and they will be making a profit. At the same time, your credit report health will improve drastically.

## How do I perform a pay for deletion?

To perform a PFD you must contact the collections company - it is rather intimidating, scary, and stressful. These companies use scare tactics against you, and aren't always the most politically correct when it comes to talking to their 'customers'. But you have to grin and bear it - the end rewards here can be worth it.

Before you even think of performing a PFD make sure you have the funds to actually carry out the PFD. You don't want to negotiate a deal, and not have the cash to pay for it. This deal will not last for 6 months, and you should plan on paying it immediately.

### Steps:

1. **Call the collections company** - the phone number to reach them should be on the contact information of your credit reports.

2. **Have your account number ready**, let the rep know your name, and the account number they have on file for you.

3. **Let them know that you are disputing the validity of this debt**, and you have never heard of it before. However, the affect it is having on your credit is causing you undue stress and that you'd like to pay it in exchange for them removing it from your credit reports. Don't use the terms 'pay for deletion' and if you can help it 'deleted' (use 'removed' instead).

4. **If you have 100% of the debt**, you can choose to offer 100%. Some companies are willing to go as low as 50%, some 70% of the debt. Feel them out, and use your negotiation skills. If you are too intimidated and embarrassed with the whole affair, pay 100%.

5. **If the agent is not willing to entertain any of this**, ask to speak to a supervisor. Let them know you are fully willing to pay this debt for its removal, you simply do not affirm its validity.

6. **If you are getting nowhere**, call back another time and speak to another person in the organization. If after several calls you are getting nowhere, you may just have a collections company not willing to bargain.

7. **If they do agree**, let them know you need this offer in writing, signed by an authorized person at their company able to make that offer. Let them know you want them to state that upon completion of this process, your legal obligation towards this debt is fulfilled. **Do not send a penny without proof of the deal!** If all is said and done and they do not hold up their end of the bargain to delete, you can dispute the account to the 3 bureaus and that offer letter (with your money order) you requested is the proof you have for it to be deleted.

8. **Once you have the signed offer letter in the mail**, send a money order with the money owed (photocopy everything before you send it). Don't send a check - they now know your checking account number and have your signature on file. They may do nothing with that information, but again some are unscrupulous entities.

9. **The waiting game now starts.** If you don't see a deletion within 2 months of sending out your payment, contact the 3 bureaus and initiate a dispute with them. In your letter, state the account should never have been on your reports, you paid the company regardless of that fact for them to remove it, and that letter they sent you of the deal affirms the fact the account does **not** belong on your reports.

## What are some other benefits of pay for deletion?

The obvious benefit of the health of your credit report improving, there are some positive legal implications there. Mainly, they **cannot** take you to court. You've fulfilled your debt obligations! Let's give an example: you are able to dispute the collections account off your reports and it is no longer hindering your credit. That collections company can still take you to court if you are within the statute of limitations in your state, and if they win you could have a judgement which is far more damaging when all is said and done. Performing a pay for deletion *fulfills* your debt obligations and you no longer owe them a penny.

## Are there any risks involved?

One member of r/Credit pointed out that there may be some proverbial "poking of the bear" involved with some extreme junk debt collections companies. There is a risk where your offer of a pay for deletion may indicate to them you *can* in fact pay for the debt. This may give them enough confidence to actually decide to take you to court, since it seems as though you do have the money on hand. If this scenario is to occur, you are not completely out of luck - you could just simply pay before the court date and thus your obligations are complete. Be aware though that this is a possible risk.

# Wiki: Guide to Authorized Users, Benefits, and Dangers

The following guide should help you to understand the authorized users strategy, what it entails, the benefits, dangers, and frequently asked questions.

## What are authorized users?

Authorized users are individuals who are authorized to make purchases on a credit card account. They will get a card issued in their name, and will be able to use that card at its' designated shopping locations as often as they'd like.

## What are authorized users responsible for?

Authorized users are responsible for absolutely nothing. They are simply allowed to make purchases - they don't get a bill in the mail and have no responsibility to pay back anything on purchases they have made.

## What are the benefits of being an authorized user?

There are many benefits to being an authorized user. First and foremost, it will appear on your credit report *as if* that card is yours. In almost all cases you will inherit the entire credit history of that card on your credit report. For an example, if your mother adds you as an authorized user on her 14 year old credit card, you will have a 14 year old card on your credit report. The entry will look almost identical to hers. The only difference is the "Owner" or "Responsibility" label is "Authorized User" instead of "Individual" or "Joint". You could quickly boost your score hundreds of points being added as an authorized user on a few cards.

## What are the disadvantages of being an authorized user?

As with the pros, there are some cons to having an authorized user credit card on your credit report. As in the previous question, your entry on your report will be almost identical to the account owner. If the account owner racks up a large balance, you will also show a high balance on your report. If they miss a payment, you will now have a missed payment on your report. If they get into trouble and pay 60 days late for an entire year, it will appear to creditors that you also are paying 60 days late!

Make **sure** to only be added as an authorized user from someone with *impeccable* credit. Someone who is extremely diligent with paying their cards on time, and maintaining a healthy balance. Your asset can quickly turn into a liability.

One important thing to remember is that in almost **all** cases, you cannot have authorized user cards on your report if you are applying for a mortgage. Mortgage companies want to see just *your* credit history, not someone else's. You will be denied in almost all cases for having these cards on your report if you apply - simply asking for them to disregard it won't change anything as it is still affecting your score. Keep this in mind as this is not an easy way to be eligible for a mortgage!

## What are the risks to the account owner?

The most important thing to know and is frequently asked is your credit past will not impact theirs. You will not lower their score simply by being added as an authorized user.

With that in mind though, you will be authorized to make purchases. An easy way to destroy this risk is to cut the card up. Since the authorized user doesn't have a card, can't login online, can't make purchases, can't access your account or make changes there is pretty much zero risk left. This is a good statement to make when having a conversation with someone who isn't sure about adding you as an authorized user. The card being sent is sent to the account owner in almost **all** cases, and is almost only sent to the authorized users' address unless specified.

## Can authorized users change/see my account information?

No, they cannot. They cannot call customer service, request any information, change information, or do anything the account owner can. They are pretty much a stranger at that point to the credit card company. They cannot even request a 'new' card - the account owner must do that.

## How are they able to match it to my report with only my name/birth date, etc?

In most cases (especially for department store cards) they will not ask for your social security number. They will however be able to match you from your meta personal information. This includes birth date, address, and name. Take for example asking to be placed on your mother's card as an authorized user. You have the same last name, are currently living or have lived at the same address at some point in your life, and your birth date matches. That is enough to make a solid match.

Interestingly enough you'll find that most matches don't even use the full social security number when making any report matches. Hence the sheer number of mis-matches that currently occur.

## Who is eligible to become an authorized user?

Anyone is technically eligible to become an authorized user - however there are some exceptions. It is recommended that only spouses, family members, and friends living at the same address should perform this credit strategy. 10+ years ago, the authorized user credit boost could be done by anyone. Some unscrupulous individuals would *sell* the rights to be an authorized user, and because of that the credit bureaus at one point considered removing the boost completely.

They didn't follow through with that though, and are now only providing this benefit to individuals with an actual tie to one another. Spouses would have very similar information, as would family members, and close friends who live together would as well. Someone who you've never had any contact with, with no matching personal information would simply just not show up on your credit report and no benefits would be achieved.

## How do I become an authorized user?

Becoming an authorized user is very easy, but obviously requires the action of the account owner. They will need to call customer service for their card, and request to add an authorized user. If you cannot be there for the phone call, supply to them your personal information (name, address, social security number, and birth date). They may not be asked for all that information, but supply it just in case they do.

They will then ask about sending a card - in almost all cases it will be sent to the account owner's address. You can most definitely confirm this. You can also request that a card is not sent - but if one is you can simply shred it. Or, use it - but that is a conversation had with the account owner and not covered in this article.

## How do I remove my authorized user status from my reports?

The account owner can call the credit card company and request your removal. You should see the entry disappear from your reports as soon as a month or a few months. To expedite this process you can and should dispute the entry on your reports. This should be an extremely easy removal since technically it's not your account, and they can see it falling into a negative entry (if that is the case scenario).

# Wiki: Credit Cards

## What are credit cards?

A **credit card** is a revolving account, which means that any unpaid balance 'revolves' to the next month's billing cycle. A creditor lends you a line of credit that you may borrow against at any time, up to a pre-determined limit, and in exchange you pay a certain percentage in interest for accessing the credit line. Credit cards can be useful for several reasons, the two primary reasons being to make a large purchase and spread the cost of the purchase over several months, or to benefit from rewards offered by card issuers.

While credit cards are often seen as 'evil' or 'dangerous', properly used, a credit card can be very beneficial. They can be used to build a solid credit history, reap rewards and bonuses, and buffer the cost of large and/or unexpected expenses. However, credit card debt can be very dangerous if handled incorrectly and can quickly lead to hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest and fees, and can cause long lasting damage to your credit score. Credit cards should never be used as a source of income and should be paid off in full each month whenever possible.

## Do I need a credit card?

That is a decision you will have to make. There are many benefits, but also many pitfalls. If you can control your spending and manage your money wisely, credit cards can be a great tool. However, there are many people that do not - for whatever reason - handle credit cards responsibly. Sometimes, this may be due to unavoidable life circumstances, but all too often it is due to individuals buying things they do not need and/or cannot afford. You should never buy anything with a credit card just because 'your credit limit will let you'. You should only spend money that you have - in other words, don't buy something with a credit card unless you have the money in the bank to pay it off immediately.

There are many people who go their entire life without a credit card and they survive just fine. There are others that had credit cards when they were younger and ran into trouble and will never touch one again. And further still, there are people who spend a reasonable amount each month on their credit cards, pay them off in full each month and gain benefits to their credit history and bonuses in the form of points, miles or cash back. And, of course, there are people who max out their cards every month, cannot manage their spending, and spiral further and further into debt each month. We would all like to think that we would never be the person who lets their debt spiral out of control or would be so careless as to spend money they know they cannot afford to pay back. However, you must keep in mind, even the most disciplined and well intentioned individuals can suddenly fall on hard times. Unexpected illness or death, major home or car repairs, loss of employment, divorce, marriage, birth of a child, lawsuit... you name it - life happens. If you do not have a plan in place to help absorb some of the risk associated with these emergencies, even the most careful and responsible individuals can quickly fall into a debt trap.

Ultimately, the decision to get a credit card is yours and yours alone. Everyone must weigh the pros and cons of credit card ownership for themselves.

## Why might I want a credit card?

You may ask yourself "If I am going to pay it off immediately, why have one?" One reason that is heard quite often is "to build credit". What does that mean exactly? Basically, to build up your credit file, you have to use credit. Seems pretty straight forward. There are different types of credit (mortgage, car loan, etc), but credit cards are the easiest to use and the most accessible to most people. People with little to no credit may face significant challenges when trying to get approved for a mortgage or car loan, for example, but most people will not have trouble getting approval for a credit card. Now, it might be a credit card with a low limit and a high interest rate, but there is a credit card available for nearly everyone. By using your credit card responsibly and paying it off each month, you will begin to build a credit file, which in turn will slowly start to increase your credit score (as long as you keep paying on time). As your score increases, you will get better offers on loans and lines of credit.

Another reason may be to reap benefits from rewards programs. Many credit cards offer points, cash back, airline miles or other bonuses for using their card. Depending on your spending habits, an individual could easily rack up thousands of dollars worth of rewards per year. But, don't go out spending everything you have on credit cards just yet. You must keep in mind that these bonuses only pay off if you completely pay your card off in full each month lest you pay interest on your purchases. A typical bonus may be as high as 3%, but the lowest interest rates will be around 8%, so you can see that if you pay interest on a purchase, you effectively lose your bonus. For rewards to be profitable, you *must* be able to pay your card off in full each month.

The last reason someone may want a credit card is to make a large purchase and spread the cost out over several months. This purchase could be an emergency - say a major, unexpected car repair. Or, the purchase could be planned - say you are moving from a furnished apartment to a new house, you will probably need to spend several thousand dollars on furniture and you may not have that much cash on hand. Using a credit card allows you to 'buffer' these costs and spread the burden out over several months. The catch, of course, is that you will have to pay interest on your purchases. This is not an ideal use for a credit card, but it is a valid use all the same. There are instances where someone may be able to qualify for a credit card with 0% introductory rate on a card. If paid in full before the introductory period expires, an item can be bought and paid for on a credit card interest free. However, it should be noted that if the item is not paid for in full by the time the introductory period ends, the *full* amount of interest starting on the day the item was purchased will often be charged.

## What is a secured credit card?

A secured debt is a debt that is backed by something of value. For example, a house or car loan could be considered a 'secured' loan because they are backed by something of value. If you don't pay for your house or your car, they will be taken from you to cover the cost of the loan. Most credit cards are unsecured, in other words, if you don't pay your credit card bill, the bank doesn't have an easy way to recoup their losses.

A secured credit card is a credit card that is backed by some type of security - often times a Certificate of Deposit. Different banks and card issuers have different policies, but generally your credit limit will be whatever the value of the security is. For example, if you apply for a secured credit card and set up a security deposit of $500, your credit limit will be $500. The advantage of a secured card is you will almost definitely be approved, no matter how thin or how bad your credit is because if you don't pay, the bank will take your security deposit to cover your bill. There have been people who have reported being denied a secured credit card, but these are infrequent and may have been denied for other reasons (perhaps too many inquiries and *not* because of a low score).

It can be a great way for those with no credit or bad credit to start to build a better credit file. The catch, of course, is you have to have the cash up front and it will be locked away and unusable to you. Again, it will vary from card issuer to card issuer, but a common setup is you will have to open a 2 year CD for whatever you want your credit limit to be. At the end of 2 years, you will get your original money back, plus interest and your secured credit card (assuming you have been paying on time) will be converted to an unsecured credit card.

It should be noted, too, that a secured credit card is treated by your credit score the same as an unsecured credit card. Payment history, utilization rate, inquiries, etc all still apply.

## What is the difference between Visa, Mastercard and American Express?

Visa and Mastercard do not issue cards directly to consumers. They both only process and facilitate the transaction between you, your bank and the seller. They may provide certain blanket benefits (e.g. fraud protection, warranty extension, etc), but otherwise your bank is the one that determines your eligibility and credit limit. There are some minor differences between Visa and Mastercard, but primarily they are basically equivalent. The advantage to Mastercard/Visa over AMEX is they typically do not charge an annual fee and they are accepted at almost any location that accepts plastic. The choice between the two may be made for you if your bank only issues one or the other. If you get a choice between the two, compare interest rates and rewards. If those are equivalent and you still don't know which one to choose, flip a coin.

American Express issues cards directly to consumers. The credit card market is loosening up as of recently, but for a long time, there were agreements between banks and Mastercard/Visa to not offer AMEX through banks. This meant that you could *only* get an AMEX card directly from AMEX. Now, however, many banks are offering AMEX cards. While the cards are still issued via AMEX directly to the consumer, the bank will 'manage' the account and all payments, etc will go through the bank. *Generally* speaking, AMEX tends to be considered a 'higher quality' card, but also typically requires a higher credit score and often times requires annual fees. However, the perception of AMEX being a card issuer of elite cards is starting to wane. That being said, AMEX *is* known for having usually nice reward programs and exceptional customer service. It should be noted, though, that AMEX is not accepted in as many locations as Mastercard/Visa.

All-in-all, the three major credit card companies are all mostly the same. There are some minor differences between the three, but realistically it doesn't really matter which one you use. Look for a card that has the lowest interest rate and gives you the best rewards, the rest is mostly just minor details.

# Important Post: Yes There Are More Than Three Credit Bureaus

Many people are misinformed and sharing advice all the time that there are only 3 credit bureaus. In fact there are many, many more. Some do double duty as debt collectors, some focus on certain niches, some love to fly under the radar but are used extensively in certain markets, etc.

**They all impact each and every one of us.**

Some may be called a consumer reporting agency vs credit reporting agency, but they are essentially the same thing. They report much of the same information and in many cases much more than the big 3. Many of them maintain separate credit scoring models as well.

The more common ones include: **Innovis, SageStream, ChexSystems, PRBC, and LexisNexis.**

## Things to know about these other bureaus:

1. **You think dealing with the big 3 is a pain? You haven't seen anything yet.** It is extremely frustrating dealing with these other bureaus. Especially for freezes (they hate that, because that means less money for them). Expect to do everything by mail, multiple times, with a lot of "sorry we can't validate your identity" excuses.

2. **Some of them get WAY more data than you realize.** Go pull your LexisNexis reports and be surprised what they have on you that is not directly related to credit but used for all sorts of modeling and marketing.

3. **They love the fact everyone ignores them or don't even know they exist.** You should manage them as much if not even more closely than the big 3.

4. **Many of their reports / scores can dramatically impact things** such as insurance rates in some states so ignoring them can cost you a lot of money you didn't realize. They are used in banking, background checks, insurance, traditional credit, rental checks and other areas.

5. **Their scoring systems are not nearly as well known** and can behave dramatically differently from FICO / Vantage. Have a 750+ FICO / Vantage score? Well your score from one of these might be mid 400s and with very little information around on how to improve it.

6. **They all fall under the same FCRA regulation** so your rights with them are the same with the big 3. You have the right to ensure they have correct information and the right to dispute it (be prepared though, see #1).

7. **There are many "sub" reports** such as a CLUE report from LexisNexis which is used for accident claims. Errors on these can cost you significant amount of money and you need to monitor them as well.
