## Disputing Incorrect Information

### CFPB Official Guide
[How to Dispute an Error on Your Credit Report](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/)

### Key Points

- **Send via certified mail** with return receipt (CMRRR)
- **Be specific** about what is wrong
- **Include documentation** (copies, not originals)
- **Bureaus have 30-45 days** to investigate

### Your Rights Under FCRA
- Right to dispute inaccurate information
- Bureaus must investigate within 30 days (45 if you provide documents)
- If unverifiable, item must be removed
- You can add a 100-word statement to your file

## Pay For Deletion (PFD) Guide

Pay For Deletion is negotiating with a collection agency to pay a debt in exchange for removing it from your credit report.

### How It Works
1. **Contact the collector** in writing
2. **Offer payment** (often less than full amount)
3. **Request deletion** as condition of payment
4. **Get agreement in writing** before paying
5. **Pay only after** receiving written agreement
6. **Verify deletion** on your credit reports

### Sample PFD Letter
```
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]

[Collection Agency]
[Their Address]

Re: Account #[ACCOUNT NUMBER]

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing regarding the above-referenced account. I am prepared
to pay [AMOUNT] to resolve this debt, provided that [COLLECTION
AGENCY] agrees to the following:

1. Accept [AMOUNT] as payment in full
2. Delete all references to this account from all credit bureaus
   (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
3. Cease all collection activities

If you agree to these terms, please respond in writing on company
letterhead. Upon receipt of your written agreement, I will remit
payment via [certified check/money order].

This is not an acknowledgment of the validity of this debt and is
made for settlement purposes only.

Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
[Your Name]
```

### Tips
- Start with a low offer (25-50% of balance)
- Be patient - negotiations take time
- **Never pay before getting written agreement**
- Follow up if they verbally agree but don't send letter

## Authorized User Guide

Being added as an Authorized User (AU) on someone else's credit card can help build your credit.

### Benefits
- Inherit the account's age (if bank backdates)
- Inherit payment history
- Add to your credit mix
- No credit check required

### Requirements for Best Results
- Account should be **old** (5+ years ideal)
- **Low utilization** (<10%)
- **Perfect payment history**
- Primary holder should be trusted family member

### Which Banks Backdate?
| Bank | Backdates AU? |
|------|---------------|
| Chase | ✓ Yes |
| Citi | ✓ Yes |
| Bank of America | ✓ Yes |
| Wells Fargo | ✓ Yes |
| US Bank | ✓ Yes |
| Barclays | ✓ Yes |
| American Express | ✗ No |
| Capital One | ✗ No |
| Discover | ✗ No |

### Risks
- If primary holder misses payment, it affects your credit too
- If primary holder maxes out card, high utilization hits you too
- Lenders may discount AU accounts when evaluating applications

## Statute of Limitations by State

The statute of limitations (SOL) is how long a creditor can sue you for a debt. **This is different from the 7-year credit reporting period.**

[Credit Card Statute of Limitations by State](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-state-statute-limitations-1282.php)

### Common SOL Periods
| State | Written Contracts | Credit Cards |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| California | 4 years | 4 years |
| Texas | 4 years | 4 years |
| Florida | 5 years | 4 years |
| New York | 6 years | 6 years |
| Illinois | 5 years | 5 years |

**Note:** Making a payment or acknowledging the debt can restart the SOL clock in many states.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is credit and why does it matter?
Credit is a score (300-850) that predicts your risk to lenders. Higher scores get better interest rates and loan terms. Your score matters when applying for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, apartments, and sometimes jobs.

### Why is my score different at each bureau?
Not all creditors report to all 3 bureaus. Your Equifax report may have different accounts than your Experian report. Different information = different scores.

### Why can't I access my credit report?
Credit bureaus ask security questions to verify your identity. If you answer wrong (or if questions are about accounts you don't recognize), access is denied. For thin files, many questions may have "None of the above" as the correct answer.

### Should I use a credit repair company?
**r/CRedit consensus: No.** Credit repair companies can't do anything you can't do yourself for free. Many use illegal tactics (disputing accurate information) that can backfire. See the [CFPB warning about credit repair scams](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-are-credit-repair-scams-en-1343/).

## Rules to Remember

1. **Disputing is your power** - You have the legal right to challenge any information on your credit report
2. **Get everything in writing** - Verbal promises mean nothing
3. **Certified mail creates proof** - Always use CMRRR for important letters
4. **Patience pays off** - Credit repair takes time, not money
5. **Beware of scams** - If someone promises to "fix" your credit quickly, it's likely a scam
