**Happy New Year, Everyone!!**

If you've spent much time looking around our sub, you've probably found our r/CRedit FAQ and Credit Myth Megathreads, or you've seen our sub's frequent contributors answering questions and/or providing guidance on a multitude of credit topics, including, of course, FICO scoring. It's also entirely possible that you've read something, and immediately said to yourself, 'Yea, but how do they know that?'

**TL;DR:** No one gave us a book on how credit and FICO scoring works. We had to write one. How do you do that? Data Points (DPs). I've created a new 'Data Point' post flair to try to revive that practice in our sub. What do I/we want you to do? Share yours.

## The Full Story

While I actually had a lot of fun writing the next sections of this thread, you can skip the stuff between the lines, if you're not a credit or Star Wars 'nerd', but I think it's pretty good stuff!

When it comes to almost all things credit related, the truth is, no one gives us a manual. Outside of some very basic 'guidelines', our banks, credit unions, lenders, and especially FICO, seem perfectly content to keep us mostly in the dark on the inner workings of the lending industry and credit scoring systems. In other words, there was no 'Credit For Dummies'. We had to steal the Death Star plans...and write one.

### A Long Time Ago...

The search for knowledge on credit related topics has been going on for decades, but through the 'miracle' of the Internet, an unaffiliated collection of interested 'hobbyists' all found their way to the myFICO (MF) Community Forums, where they would ask questions, test their own credit profiles, compare notes, debate theories, and try to learn. Sometime in late 2019 or early 2020, one of them came across...wait for it...a Reddit post that claimed to 'know' all sorts of things about how FICO scoring works. Some of it was accurate. A lot of it was not. A MF member copied/pasted it on the MF Forums for discussion and debate, and this group of 'hobbyists' came to a quick conclusion. They knew way more than this thread claimed to. They could do better.

### Master Yoda

While the MF group had amassed a ton of 'fragments' of knowledge, there had been no real 'central' effort made to collect, organize, and then 'publish' them into a living, breathing document that might let 'ordinary' people break right into FICO's 'black box'. The Reddit post was just the motivation needed. Enter MF Legend **Birdman7**, known to Reddit as u/MFBirdman7. Combining his and the group's collective knowledge and research, along with hundreds...probably thousands...of Data Points, and the tiny little bit of information released publicly by FICO, he published the first version of the FICO hobbyist community's "Bible" in 2020, the **Credit Scoring Primer (CSP)**, giving everyone the blueprints to the Empire's most widely used 'weapon'...FICO 8.

### "You Must Unlearn What You Have Learned"

What the hell is a scorecard? Percentage of on-time payments isn't a scoring factor? Utilization has no memory?!? Credit limits aren't a scoring factor? Closed accounts age counts the same as open ones, and they still keep aging after they're closed? Speaking of credit age... AAoA, AoYA, AoOOIA...did you invent a new language, because I don't have a protocol droid that speaks Bocce.

Folks, to say the CSP was 'controversial' might be the understatement of all time. The problem was...he wasn't guessing. It was all backed up by research, testing, and confirmed Data Points. Did it contain some mistakes? You bet. Did it explain everything about how the algorithms work? No way, but it was/is the most comprehensive compilation of tested and proven information about FICO scoring ever written, and the comments section became a gold mine of debate, discussion, and Data Points, as people couldn't wait to have something they could share and contribute.

### The Empire Strikes Back

We'll never know for sure if it was getting sideways with a Lord Vader MF moderator, or if the MF mods were given orders from the Emperor himself, but it wasn't too long until the CSP (and all its comment section Kyber) found itself targeted by single-reactor ignition and vaporized. Although, amazingly enough, it was restored to the site some time later, author listed as 'Anonymous', and it remains there today. Its true author, Birdman7, expelled from the Jedi Order...banned from the entire MF Forums platform. Undaunted, he brought his knowledge over to Reddit, and I had the great fortune that, when I found r/CRedit in 2021 while trying to learn how to repair and rebuild my own credit, he picked one of my comments to respond to and provide advice. Afterwards, he took a lot of time to reply to a lot more of my comments and eventually DMs, and not long after, he gave me the location of his new secret base.

### The Rebel Alliance

While being a major contributor on this sub and several others, he was also working on a new venture...**Credit Rebels**. A sanctuary for those who wanted to share anything and everything about the world of credit with an emphasis on it being an independent, centralized place for discussion and debate, knowledge sharing, and of course, to continue to compile all those Data Points in the never-ending quest to unlock more of the Empire's weapons. Several of this sub's frequent contributors, myself included, followed him there, and we started to build it from the ground up, and in 2022, Birdman published **CSP v2**, revised and expanded with tons of new information we had all worked diligently to 'unlock'.

### A Disturbance In The Force

**In May 2023, we all got the news that Birdman had been tragically killed in an automobile accident.** To say our little community was 'shaken' is nowhere close. 'Shattered' might be the accurate term. Not too long after, those of us remaining experienced our own version of Order 66, as the website went defunct, mountains of Data Points were lost to us, and the collaborative effort just kind of faded away. Several of us remained active in various credit forums, and would 'see' each other from time to time, maybe leaving a comment or an upvote along the way.

### A New Hope

Last year, as this sub was dangerously close to burning to the ground, the Reddit gods stepped in, and appointed a new mod team. Once they were in place, I was incredibly fortunate that they picked me to join the team. Some of the first things I did were to create a Megathread to consolidate and 'house' Top Contributor u/BrutalBodyShots' Credit Myth series, and then got to work reconstructing the archives, by taking Birdman's CSP v1 and v2, breaking them down by FICO scoring category, revising and expanding with new information, and then posting them in the FAQ Megathread.

Folks, I'll never be u/MFBirdman7, but the 'signature block' on my old Credit Rebels account literally included, **"Birdman's Padawan"**, and I'm ready to get back to it, but I need our sub's help.

## The Call to Action

As this sub has grown into a massive community well over 300K strong, we've become very good at giving advice (for the most part), but we've "mostly" stopped collecting the raw data that makes the advice possible in the first place. So, how do you reverse-engineer an algorithm? Data Points. Lots and lots of them. I've created the new 'Data Point' flair in an attempt to revive the tradition that built our knowledge in the first place. This flair really isn't for asking questions or for advice—it's for reporting both general credit and FICO score intel from the front lines. What does this have to do with you? Everything.

### What makes a "Good" Data Point?

A screenshot of a score moving up or down 20 points is a start, but without the "Why," it's basically just noise. To truly help us keep the FAQ and the "Bible" updated, we need the context. When you use the new flair, please try to include whatever you can from the following:

1. **The Action (What just happened?):** Got approved/denied for a card or a CLI, and which report(s) did they pull? Changes on your reports and associated score loss/gain.

2. **The Specific Score(s):** 'Experian FICO 8 went up 15 points' tells us a lot. 'My score dropped' tells us nothing.

3. **Credit Profile Context:** Tell us a little about your credit history. Clean/Dirty? How long you've had credit? How many accounts? You don't have to post your whole credit report(s), but some context of your particular profile helps a ton.

4. **The "Reason Codes":** If your score(s) changed, look at the "Negative Factors" listed, if your CMS shows them, and post them. These are the literal breadcrumbs the algorithm leaves behind.

I'm asking everyone—from the lurkers to the frequent posters—to help us continue the work. Let's keep 'cracking the code', one Data Point at a time.

## Top Comment by BrutalBodyShots (Top Contributor)

Fantastically written post above!

The most important part of any data point, IMO, is that it's what we call "clean" - that is, free of multiple potential variables. One of the biggest issues many of us hobbyists have run into over the years has been the ability to obtain clean data points. I think the majority of true FICO score hobbyists are pretty good at being able to tell if a data point is clean or not. For your casual observer that just checks their score once a month however, not so much.

Often we see false data points reported (sometimes known as false positives) and it's important to decipher which fall into this category. Some are easy to tell... they may sound like "I paid my $350 credit card balance down to $50 and my score dropped 8 points!" Since we know that's an impossibility, it's a bad data point. Many times these come from believing the myth that a credit monitoring service can tell you why your score changed.

Anyway, I only bring this up because it's of course important to obtain clean data points. Fortunately there are a lot of great FICO scoring minds on this sub like the author of this thread u/soonersoldier33 that can help this process. As he said, focus on context. Aside from what obviously changed on your credit reports, what else changed? Anything? Using the FICO negative reason codes can be key.

I look forward to seeing more "Data Point" contributions in the upcoming months and learning more about this fun hobby that so many of us are fascinated by ;)

> Love the Star Wars parallel and the enthusiasm. I've definitely reaped way more than I've sewn in this community over the past few years (and I'm very grateful to those who have been around longer so that I even could). Time to tend the garden (double meaning, IYKYK)!

**soonersoldier33 reply:**
> Thanks, Doc, but I disagree! You've 'sewn' plenty! I'm in the garden right there with you now, but when you're in the garden is the perfect time for testing! You can test all kinds of things while you're gardening. Lol

**relevantfico:**
> Great post! Love the history and Star Wars metaphors. I have a few data points I'm planning on sharing, and this is the motivation to write the posts!
