# Credit Scoring 101: A Beginner's Guide

*A simplified introduction based on the Credit Scoring Primer*

## What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a number (300-850) that predicts how likely you are to pay back borrowed money. Higher = better.

| Score Range | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| 800-850 | Exceptional |
| 740-799 | Very Good |
| 670-739 | Good |
| 580-669 | Fair |
| 300-579 | Poor |

**Why it matters:** Lenders use your score to decide whether to approve you and what interest rate to charge. A higher score = better rates = less money paid in interest.

## The 5 Things That Affect Your Score

Think of your score like a pie with 5 slices:

### 1. Payment History (35%) - THE BIG ONE
**What it is:** Whether you pay your bills on time.

**Key points:**
- One late payment can drop your score 50-100+ points
- The more recent the late, the worse the damage
- After 7 years, most negative items fall off

**What to do:** Pay at least the minimum on everything, every month, on time.

---

### 2. How Much You Owe (30%)
**What it is:** How much of your available credit you're using (called "utilization").

**The magic number:** Keep your credit card balances below **9.5%** of your limits.

**Example:**
- You have a card with a $1,000 limit
- Keep your balance below $95 when the statement closes
- Even better: below $45 (4.5%) for maximum points

**Warning - The "All Zero" Trap:**
If ALL your cards report $0 balance, you actually LOSE 10-25 points! Keep a small balance ($5-20) on ONE card.

---

### 3. How Long You've Had Credit (15%)
**What it is:** The age of your credit accounts.

**Key points:**
- Older accounts = better
- Don't close old cards, even if you don't use them
- Opening new accounts lowers your average age

**Important thresholds:**
- 36 months (3 years): You move to a "mature" scorecard
- 90 months (7.5 years): Believed to be near maximum benefit

---

### 4. New Credit (10%)
**What it is:** Recent applications for credit.

**Key points:**
- Each application creates a "hard inquiry"
- Inquiries hurt your score for 12 months
- They fall off your report after 24-26 months
- Multiple inquiries for the same type of loan within 14-45 days count as one

**The Chase 5/24 Rule:** Chase will deny most credit cards if you've opened 5+ cards (any bank) in the last 24 months.

---

### 5. Credit Mix (10%)
**What it is:** The variety of credit types you have.

**Good to have a mix of:**
- Credit cards (revolving credit)
- Auto loan, mortgage, student loans (installment loans)

**Ideal ratio:** About 3-4 credit cards to 1 loan.

---

## Quick Wins to Improve Your Score

### 1. Pay Down Credit Cards
Get all cards below 9.5% utilization. This can boost your score in just one billing cycle.

### 2. AZEO Strategy (All Zero Except One)
- Pay all cards to $0 before their statement dates
- Leave a small balance ($5-50) on ONE card
- This gives you low utilization without the All-Zero penalty

### 3. Don't Close Old Cards
Even if you don't use a card, keeping it open helps your:
- Average age of accounts
- Total available credit (lowers utilization)

### 4. Become an Authorized User
Ask a family member with a long-standing, well-managed credit card to add you as an authorized user. Their good history can boost your score.

### 5. Stop Applying for Credit
Every application hurts your score. If you're trying to improve, stop applying for 6-12 months ("gardening").

## Common Myths Debunked

### ❌ "Checking my own score hurts it"
**Truth:** Checking your own score is a "soft inquiry" and has NO effect.

### ❌ "I need to carry a balance to build credit"
**Truth:** You don't. Pay your full balance each month. Just make sure the statement shows a small balance before you pay it.

### ❌ "Closing cards I don't use will help"
**Truth:** It usually hurts. It reduces your available credit and can lower your average account age.

### ❌ "My income affects my score"
**Truth:** Income is NOT part of your credit score. Lenders consider it separately.

### ❌ "All credit scores are the same"
**Truth:** There are many different scoring models. FICO 8 is the most common, but mortgages use FICO 2/4/5.

---

## The Scorecards System (Advanced but Important)

FICO doesn't score everyone the same way. You're placed on one of 12 "scorecards" based on your profile:

**Clean scorecards** (no major negatives):
- Thick (4+ accounts) vs Thin (fewer accounts)
- Mature (oldest account 3+ years) vs Young
- No New Revolver (no new cards in 12 months) vs New Revolver

**Dirty scorecards** (have major negatives like 60+ day lates, collections, bankruptcy):
- You're compared against others with similar negatives
- This limits your maximum achievable score

**Why this matters:** When you cross a threshold (like hitting 3 years), you change scorecards. This can cause a temporary score drop even though it's actually progress!

---

## Fixing Negative Items

### For Accurate Negative Items (you really were late):
1. **Wait it out** - Impact decreases over time
2. **Goodwill letter** - Ask the creditor nicely to remove it
3. **Use the Saturation Technique** - Send letters to multiple addresses

### For Inaccurate Items (errors on your report):
1. **Dispute with the bureau** (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
2. Provide documentation
3. They have 30 days to investigate
