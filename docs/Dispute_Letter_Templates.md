4. **Be specific** about what is wrong and what the correct information is
5. **One dispute per letter** - don't combine multiple issues
6. **Follow up** if you don't hear back within 30-45 days

[Credit Bureau Name]
[Credit Bureau Address]

Re: Dispute of Account - Not My Account
SSN: XXX-XX-[Last 4]
DOB: [Your DOB]

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to dispute the following account that appears on my credit
report, as this account does not belong to me:

Creditor Name: [CREDITOR NAME]
Account Number: [ACCOUNT NUMBER]
Reported Balance: [BALANCE]

I have never opened an account with this creditor, nor have I authorized
anyone to open an account on my behalf. This appears to be either a case
of identity theft or a mixed credit file error.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Section 611, I request that
you investigate this matter and remove this account from my credit report.

Please provide me with:
1. A copy of any application or documentation bearing my signature
2. Proof that this account belongs to me
3. The method of verification used

Enclosed please find copies of:
- My driver's license
- [Additional ID if applicable]

Please investigate this matter and remove this inaccurate account from
my credit report. I request written confirmation of the results within
30 days as required by law.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
